### The Scholar & Feminist Conference XXXVI

#### Presented by The Department of Social & Cultural Analysis at New York University 

**Saturday, February 26, 2011**
**9:00 am - 4:00 pm**
**Barnard College**
**3009 Broadway (at 117th Street)**
**New York, NY**

This year's Scholar & Feminist conference brings together feminism and
disability studies, two fields that have contributed to the interrogation
of the public/private divide, and, when brought together, radically
contest and amplify the ways in which this split has produced remarkably
thin understandings and practices of accessibility, participation,
livelihood, visibility and integration. "Movements: Politics, Performance,
and Disability" will look closely at the ways in which political action
and cultural production contribute to new ways of imagining what an
inclusive society might look like. The conference will contribute to the
ongoing work of social movements dedicated to the creation of networks,
spaces, relations, and concepts of justice that are open and accessible to
all.

Through dance, film, political engagement and dialogue, we will make our
way from Barnard College to New York City to the larger world and back
again, exploring the ways in which artistic endeavors, scholarship, and
politics have all led to mobilizations for feminist and disability
activism. The conference features a series of workshops on topics
including parenting and disability, alternatives for creating community in
the face of privitization and state budget cuts, films on disability, and
a new project on oral histories with Barnard and Columbia alumnae who
identify as disabled. The day concludes with a special performance by the
Heidi Latsky Dance Company, a fully integrated dance group.
