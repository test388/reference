# The Icarus Project NYC Website

I'm developing a small, simple, easy to replicate website for The Icarus Project NYC. The goal is to have other local chapters of Icarus use this site as a template for their own websites, which could also be hosted for free on GitHub.

Because most of NYC Icarus' activities are event related, events are the focus of the site.

* Data files for easier customization of the site navigation/footer and for supporting multiple authors.
* Optional Disqus comments, table of contents, social sharing links, and Google AdSense ads.
